## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or newer)
- AWS IAM user account with VPN permissions
- Slack workspace access
- OpenVPN client or AWS VPN Client installed

## üöÄ Initial Setup (One-Time)

### Step 1: Check Your Permissions

```bash
./team_member_setup.sh --check-permissions
```

If you see permission errors, contact your VPN administrator.

### Step 2: Generate VPN Certificate

```bash
# For staging environment
./team_member_setup.sh --init --profile staging

# For production environment
./team_member_setup.sh --init --profile production
```

The script will:

1. Download CA certificate from S3
2. Generate your private key (kept locally)
3. Create certificate signing request (CSR)
4. Upload CSR for admin approval

### Step 3: Wait for Admin Approval

You'll see a message like:

```text
‚è∏Ô∏è  Setup paused, waiting for admin to sign your certificate...
Username: john.doe
CSR Location: s3://vpn-csr-exchange/csr/john.doe.csr
```

Notify your VPN administrator that your CSR is ready.

### Step 4: Complete Setup

Once approved (admin will notify you):

```bash
./team_member_setup.sh --resume --profile staging
```

This downloads your signed certificate and generates VPN configuration files.

## üíª Daily VPN Usage

### Using Slack Commands (Recommended)

#### Start VPN

```text
/vpn open staging     # Connect to staging environment
/vpn open production  # Connect to production environment
```

‚è±Ô∏è **Wait Time**: The `/vpn open` command may take up to **10 minutes** to complete as AWS provisions the VPN endpoint connections. You'll see status updates in Slack during this process.

#### Stop VPN

```text
/vpn close staging
/vpn close production
```

#### Check Status

```text
/vpn check staging
/vpn check production
```

#### View Cost Savings

```text
/vpn savings staging
```

### Connecting with VPN Client

1. **Import Configuration**:
   - Find `.ovpn` file in `downloads/` folder
   - Import into your VPN client

2. **Connect**:
   - Select the profile in your VPN client
   - Click Connect

3. **Auto-Disconnect**: VPN automatically disconnects after 54 minutes of inactivity to save costs

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "VPN endpoint is closed"

First open the VPN endpoint via Slack:

```text
/vpn open staging
```

‚è±Ô∏è **Wait for "üü¢ Open" status** (up to 10 minutes), then connect your VPN client. AWS needs time to associate subnets and configure the endpoint.

#### "Connection timed out"

1. Check VPN endpoint status: `/vpn check staging`
2. Ensure you're on stable internet
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

#### "Certificate expired"

Renew your certificate:

```bash
./team_member_setup.sh --renew --profile staging
```

#### "Access denied to specific service"

Contact admin to verify your security group permissions.

### Getting Help

1. **Slack Support**: Post in #vpn-support channel
2. **Check Status**: `/vpn check [environment]`
3. **Admin Contact**: Reach out to VPN administrators

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### Essential Slack Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/vpn open [env]` | Start VPN | `/vpn open staging` |
| `/vpn close [env]` | Stop VPN | `/vpn close staging` |
| `/vpn check [env]` | Check status | `/vpn check production` |
| `/vpn help` | Show all commands | `/vpn help` |

### Environment Names

- `staging` (aliases: `stage`, `dev`)
- `production` (aliases: `prod`)

### File Locations

```text
certs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/          # Staging certificates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ca.crt       # CA certificate
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user.crt     # Your certificate
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user.key     # Your private key (keep safe!)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production/      # Production certificates

downloads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging-vpn-config.ovpn    # Staging VPN config
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production-vpn-config.ovpn  # Production VPN config
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Your Private Key**
   - Never share `.key` files
   - Keep local backups in secure location
   - Report immediately if compromised

2. **VPN Usage**
   - Only connect when needed
   - Disconnect when finished
   - Don't share VPN access

3. **Environment Separation**
   - Use staging for development/testing
   - Only use production when necessary
   - Follow change management procedures

## üìä Cost Optimization

The system automatically manages costs by:

- Closing idle VPNs after 54 minutes
- Tracking usage and savings
- Preventing 24/7 VPN charges

```text
/vpn savings staging
/vpn costs daily
```

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Lost Private Key

1. Notify administrator immediately
2. Request certificate revocation
3. Generate new certificate

### Can't Access Critical Service

1. Check VPN connection status
2. Verify you're in correct environment
3. Contact admin for urgent access

### Suspected Security Breach

1. Disconnect VPN immediately
2. Notify security team
3. Change AWS credentials
4. Request new certificates
